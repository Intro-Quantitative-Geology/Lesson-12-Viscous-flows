## General hints

## Problem 1
### Solving for the unknown pressures in Equation 10
In Part 2 of Problem 1 you're asked to solve for the term (*p*<sub>1</sub> - *p*<sub>0</sub>) / *L* in Equation 10.
To help you know whether or not you've done this properly, I've given a table of the values you should get below.

| *n* | (*p*<sub>1</sub> - *p*<sub>0</sub>) / *L* |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- |
|  2  | 4215743440.23                             |
|  3  | 8029987.50521                             |
|  4  | 14339.2634022                             |
|  5  | 24.5815944037                             |

## Problem 2
### Solving for the unknown term in Equation 19
Similar to Problem 2, you're again asked to solve for an unknown term in Equation 19, in this case *ɣ*<sub>*x*</sub>.
As above, you have a table of values below to help you check whether or not you've properly solved your equation for *ɣ*<sub>*x*</sub>.

| *n* | *ɣ*<sub>*x*</sub> |
| --- | ----------------- |
|  1  | 8.33314255626e+12 |
|  2  | 51263351337.2     |
|  3  | 327038924.001     |
|  4  | 1955974.42585     |
|  5  | 11230.4751723     |
