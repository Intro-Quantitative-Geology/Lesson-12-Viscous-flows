# Lesson 12: Viscous flows
This week we will be introduced to the equations that govern the flow of viscous materials.
At depths greater than those where rocks deform in a brittle manner, crustal and mantle rocks can be treated as viscous fluids with very high viscosities.
Ice also behaves as a viscous fluid in glaciers, which will be further explored in [this week's exercise]().
Like the previous two weeks, we will start with a [short lecture]() about the equations of viscous flow and its application to modelling river erosion.
There are also [some notes]() posted for how to solve the advection-diffusion equation.
These are not required reading, but may be of interest for the exercise this week.
As usual we will finish with the [exercise for this week]().
